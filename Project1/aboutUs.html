				<article>
					<p>
						Our philosophy is simple: take the best quality ingredients, prepare dishes fresh to order and provide an authentic taste of Lebanon.

						The Lebanese like to share a meal and so the food is centred around mezze � smaller plates offering a wide variety of flavours from the simple to the complex and each plate has its own distinctive taste. The best way to enjoy a meal is to select a range of different mezze, both hot and cold, and then pass the time with some good conversation and a few drinks to accompany the meal.

						Arak is a popular drink in Lebanon, but people also drink Jellab (date juice), soft drinks and, of course, wine (after all, they invented it!)

						The food is wonderfully flavoursome, with a mixture of herbs and spices drawn from around the world. There is a wide variety of vegetarian dishes, as well as salads, grills and stews, and Lebanese food is considered an excellent choice for a balanced diet. Except for the steaks, all of our meat is Halal.
